# Facebook Ninja
Facebook Ninja is a very simple Chrome extension (essentially one line of code), that blocks connections to two Facebook scripts that will show when you have read a message or are typing a message.

## Notes
Using Facebook Ninja will leave all messages unread, meaning your "unread messages" count will not reset to 0.
